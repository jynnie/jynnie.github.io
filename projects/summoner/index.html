I both designed and developed the game and web application.</p><div class="img"><img src="/img/projects/summoner-PHOTO.jpg"></div><h2>challenge.</h2><p>I was inspired by mafia-like games and collaborative puzzles, and wanted to blend the two together. The challenge was to balance hidden role motivations with collaborative puzzle-solving such that players would neither feel so trusting as to all collaborate nor feel so paranoid that no one would act. </p><h2>theme.</h2><p>I first developed a story theme as a framework:</p><p class="quote"><em>Your party comprises an order of guardians vowed to protect the ancient magics. However, your party discovers one of you has betrayed the order and begun to summon a demon. Before the demon is summoned, figure out what combination of magic will vanquish the summoning circle. Or if you are a traitor, fulfill your sinister plans...</em></p><p>Players would have to take chances and obtain information to determine both who is on which side and crack the combination.</p><div class="img"><img class="mockup" src="/img/projects/summoner-flavor.png" alt="Theme Planning"></div><p>To aid information collection, traitor characters would be given tomes with traitor combinations. But two out of three of the colors in the combo are correct. Additionally, items or spells that can swap items and other actions help spread information.</p><div class="img"><img class="mockup" src="/img/projects/summoner-itemplan.png" alt="Flow Planning"></div><h2>paper prototypes.</h2><p>I began testing the game's design with paper cards prototypes. My main concerns were testing if mechanics are understandable and useful and if players would be paranoia but also motivated to communicate.</p><div class="flex"><div class="img"><img class="mockup" src="/img/projects/summoner-tome.PNG" style="max-height: 240px"></div><div class="img"><img class="mockup" src="/img/projects/summoner-red.PNG" style="max-height: 240px"></div><div class="img"><img class="mockup" src="/img/projects/summoner-item.PNG" style="max-height: 240px"></div></div><p>Testing revealed problems in the game's structure. In this iteration, players had a discussion phase followed by a combo attempt phase. However, as such, players started off with little information, resulting in rather lacking discussions. Additionally, we discovered edge cases in the combo attempt phase and players resorted to guessing.</p><h2>current iteration.</h2><p>My next couple of iterations were all web app prototypes. The platform of the web app solved the clunkiness of resolving play in phases. Real-time actions and the dissolution of phases entirely allowed players to gather information while discussing. To limit players from abusing items and spells, timed cooldowns were implemented. In addition, a countdown was instated as a time pressure. </p><div class="flex"><div class="img"><img src="/img/projects/summoner-start.gif" style="max-height: 360px"></div><div class="img"><img src="/img/projects/summoner-colors.gif" style="max-height: 360px"></div><div class="img"><img src="/img/projects/summoner-darken.gif" style="max-height: 360px"></div></div><p>In playtests with this iteration, we found more and interesting discussion. Players reported that mechanics were smoother and made more sense. For example: casting darkening, which effectively blinds another player from seeing the gamestate, worked more naturally in the app (demonstrated in the rightmost figure above). However, I found discussion still required more player initiative to begin and not descend into guessing. </p><p>I'm continuing to playtest and balance the game. Look forward to future updates!</p></div></body><footer><span>last updated: Nov 2018</span><div><a href="https://github.com/jynnie/jynnie.github.io">crafted with &lt;3 by jynnie</a></div></footer></html>
