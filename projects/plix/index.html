So we created a creative outlet for students to leave a mark on campus - digitally.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Plix Banner" src="/img/projects/PlixBanner.gif"></div><h2>problem brief.</h2><p>Murals make up an important part of culture in many communities across MIT. We wanted to capture this creative, collaborative process without the physical limitations of murals "irl". </p><p>We sought to solve problems like limits on number of collaborators at one time and ease of access. At the same time, we also wanted to preserve some physicality such as how murals are situated at a location. And of course, we anticipated friendly fire and trolls.</p><h2>a collaborative platform.</h2><p>At a basic level, we wanted a generic platform where users could collaborate in real-time on pixel boards. Part of collaboration is recognizing your cohorts. As such, we added a last users list to show who contributed to a board and when they last did so. To preserve physicality of murals, we decided to make boards location-based. This was also to reflect that murals are dorm community driven. </p><p>You can see these features mocked up below (and one of our inspirations, Reddit's r/place, included too).</p><div class="img"><img class="mockup" alt="First Mockups" src="/img/projects/PlixMock.png"></div><h2>a personal experience.</h2><p>As we began stitching together our web application, we realized we also wanted participation to be a personal experience for users as well. What if contributing to a plix board not only let you "leave your mark", but also let you remember "you wuz here"? </p><div class="img"><img alt="Dashboard" src="/img/projects/PlixDashboard.gif"></div><p>We designed a dashboard to let users succinctly see the boards and places they'd been, when they'd last been, and what was the last color pixel they contributed. It culminated a user's digital footsteps.</p><h2>a community grows.</h2><p>We began testing features and the app's reliability as soon as we had a working prototype. Listening to feedback, we changed the contributor's list to a leaderboard. We worked to make Plix mobile friendly and improve its security.</p><div class="img"><img alt="MIT Plix Board" src="/img/projects/PlixLocation.gif"></div><p>One of the most gratifying experiences was watching friends sitting together to work on portions of a pixel board. We watched communities come together and make and grow in a colorful digital world. </p></div></body><footer><span>last updated: Dec 2018</span><div><a href="https://github.com/jynnie/jynnie.github.io">crafted with &lt;3 by jynnie</a></div></footer></html>
