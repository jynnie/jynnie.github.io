I both designed and developed the web application.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Onionvale" src="/img/projects/onionvale-scroll.gif"></div><h2>problem.</h2><p>Over the semester, members of my living community enjoyed playing a collaborative text-based RPG on a whiteboard on our hall. Many wanted to continue over the summer, but how to do that when everyone is scattered over the country?</p><div class="img"><img alt="Whiteboard Onionvale" src="/img/projects/onionvale-irl.jpg"></div><p>I worked to build a platform that would support the same feel of the "irl" game. For example, in real life players could write on the whiteboard without being seen by others. Additionally, players could draw charts and maps. I worked to keep these affordances without limiting community creativity.</p><h2>design.</h2><p>What I designed was a more open text-chat-like platform where players used "bang" commands to add to the game state.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Stat Changes" src="/img/projects/onionvale-stat.gif"></div><p>This design kept anonymity and allowed anyone to play as both "player" or "game" - as one could on the whiteboard version. Additionally, classic RPG mechanics such as player stats and inventory were supported and displayed on a sidebar.</p><p>Additionally, the site was designed to be mobile friendly.</p><div class="flex"><div class="img"><img alt="Mobile View" src="/img/projects/onionvale-mobile.gif" style="max-height: 420px"></div></div><p>Few community rules (such as not allowing replies to one's own message) were enforced by the system itself. Instead, as the platform was designed for play by our small community of friends, we relied on the honor system and self-policing to uphold those community standards.</p><h2>community collaboration.</h2><p>Once I built the basic platform, the community collaborated to improve and add features. For example, a roll dice command was added. And upon request, I also developed a dark mode.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Dark Mode" src="/img/projects/onionvale-dark.gif"></div><p>Watching the game and platform develop has been an incredible and rewarding experiences. Players create a discord webhook to get notifications when the game updated and other community members have worked to improve the platform design.</p><p>Welcome to Onionvale!</p></div></body><footer><span>last updated: Dec 2018</span><div><a href="https://github.com/jynnie/jynnie.github.io">crafted with &lt;3 by jynnie</a></div></footer></html>
