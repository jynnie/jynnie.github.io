Our goal was to capture the experience of being an Ancient Greek Hero sent as tribute into Daedalus' Labyrinth.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Daedalus' Labyrinth Pieces" src="/img/projects/labyrinth-setup.JPG"></div><h2>problem.</h2><p>Our assignment was to design a game "in which the intended player experience is from a particular person's perspective within a real-world political, economic, or social system". We set out to capture the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. </p><p>The original myth starts with King Minos ordering Daedalus to construct a labyrinth to imprison the Minotaur. Every seven years, King Minos then sends seven of the strongest boys and seven of the most beautiful girls from an enemy city into the labyrinth as tribute. On the 3rd occasion, Theseus volunteers himself to stop the horror. With a sword and magic thread given to him by Ariadne, Theseus defeats the Minotaur and makes his way back out of the labyrinth.</p><h2>design.    </h2><p>In our first iterations, we stayed true to the myth's concept of Theseus vs. the Maze and Minotaur. We focused on the feeling of being lost and the power of the Ariadne's thread. However, labyrinths actually don't have branching paths and would thus be hard to get lost in. As such, we took some creative liberty and adopted a maze and over a true labyrinth. We played with the feeling of being lost more with mechanics like limited sight and maze mutations.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Early Prototype" src="/img/projects/labyrinth-prototype.jpg"></div><p>This initial idea (pictured above) was a two-player competitive game. One player plays Theseus, revealing the maze tiles around them. The other player plays the Minotaur, able to shift the maze. However, the game felt unbalanced with an overpowered hero, but untrue to the myth if both roles were equally powered.</p><p>Our team pivoted away from Theseus and towards the years of sacrifice and generic Greek hero culture. We developed a collaborative tile-drawing, tile-laying game where players played heroes gaining heroic virtues to confront the Minotaur. This model would evolve into our final game. </p><h3>calling all heroes-to-be.</h3><p class="quote">You are now in ancient Greece where the myths are true and legends are real. Every seven years, King Minos of Crete sends a group of the strongest men and most beautiful women into Daedalus’ labyrinth which imprisons the terrifying Minotaur – a half man, half beast creature. You and your fellow heroes have volunteered in hopes that you can slay the Minotaur and find your way out before the labyrinth traps you forever! You pray luck is on your side...</p><div class="img"><img alt="Bag of Labyrinth Tiles" src="/img/projects/labyrinth-bag.JPG"></div><h2>greek heroes.</h2><p>Refocusing the experience opened up many creative doors for us. We gave players patron gods and goddesses from the Greek pantheon that granted them special powers. Players uncover Greek heroic virtues as they explore the labyrinth. The more heroic virtues a player obtained, the more likely they could defeat the Minotaur. We struggled with balancing the Minotaur's AI and player powers, but with much player testing, achieved a fun and strategically-interesting balance.</p><div class="img"><img alt="Heroes Gathered" src="/img/projects/labyrinth-game.JPG"></div><h2>future prospects.</h2><p>We originally set out to create a board game. However, as we continued development, we saw great potential for a mixed media digital board game. As of December 2018, our team is discussing digital possibilities. Look forward to updates!</p><div class="img"><img alt="Signed Game Box" src="/img/projects/labyrinth-signatures.JPG"></div></div></body><footer><span>last updated: Feb 2019</span><div><a href="https://github.com/jynnie/jynnie.github.io">crafted with &lt;3 by jynnie</a></div></footer></html>
